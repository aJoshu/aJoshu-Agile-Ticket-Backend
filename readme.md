# Pointing Poker Remake

Some Pointing Poker alike react application that uses an express backend with sockets.  

Some minor bugs I haven't got around to fixing is the problem with sockets talking when deployed and sometimes when a new user joins a session it doesnt fetch on their end.

Overall a cool learning experience messing with sockets.
